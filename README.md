## ‚ùóÔ∏èBe careful before use‚ùóÔ∏è

To ensure compatibility with your Git project, it's important to verify and, if necessary, update the branch name. Start by confirming the current branch name; if it's ```main```, proceed with the update.

Navigate to the ```Settings``` tab of your GitHub repository. Within the ```Repository``` section, locate the ```Default branch``` dropdown. If the current branch is ```main```, modify it to ```master```.

Once you've made this adjustment, scroll down to find the "Save changes" button and apply the update. Your Git project is now configured with the ```master``` branch.

If you encounter any challenges during this process, reference the attached screenshot for visual guidance.
